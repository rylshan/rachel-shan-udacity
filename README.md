### Project Title
Project Title: Udacity Nanodegree Programming for Data Science with Python -- Bikeshare project

### Description
For the Bike Share project, I used Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems in three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to compute some interesting statistics from the data. The user is able to filter the information by city, month, and weekday when viewing the statistics.

### Files used
The files used were:
washington.csv ,
new_york_city.csv ,
chicago.csv
